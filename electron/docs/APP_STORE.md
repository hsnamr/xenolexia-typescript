📚 Learn a New Language by Reading Books You Love

Xenolexia transforms your reading experience into a language learning journey. Instead of memorizing flashcards, you'll learn new words naturally—in context, while enjoying your favorite books.

**How It Works:**

As you read books in your native language, Xenolexia intelligently replaces words with their foreign language equivalents. Start with common words at beginner level, and gradually encounter more complex vocabulary as you progress.

• Tap any foreign word to reveal its translation
• Save words you want to remember
• Review saved words with spaced repetition
• Track your progress and reading statistics

**Key Features:**

📖 **Read Any EPUB**
Import your own ebooks or discover free classics from Project Gutenberg.

🌍 **28+ Languages**
Learn Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, and many more.

🎯 **Adaptive Difficulty**
Choose from Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced levels. Words are selected based on real frequency data.

📝 **Smart Vocabulary**
Save words with context sentences. Review them using the proven SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm.

🎨 **Beautiful Reader**
Customize fonts, sizes, themes, and margins. Read comfortably in light or dark mode.

📊 **Track Progress**
See your reading time, words learned, and maintain learning streaks.

📤 **Export Anywhere**
Export your vocabulary to CSV, Anki, or JSON for use in other apps.

**Why Xenolexia?**

Traditional language learning apps teach words in isolation. But research shows we learn best through context. Xenolexia lets you:

✓ Learn from real, meaningful content
✓ Build vocabulary naturally
✓ Read books you actually enjoy
✓ Study at your own pace

Perfect for language enthusiasts, students, or anyone who wants to combine their love of reading with language learning.
