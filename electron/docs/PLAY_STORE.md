📚 Learn a New Language by Reading Books You Love

Xenolexia transforms your reading experience into a language learning journey. Instead of boring flashcards, learn new words naturally—in context, while enjoying your favorite books.

★ HOW IT WORKS ★

As you read books in your native language, Xenolexia intelligently replaces words with their foreign language equivalents. Start with common words at beginner level, and progress to more complex vocabulary over time.

• Tap any foreign word to reveal its translation
• Save words you want to remember
• Review saved words with spaced repetition
• Track your progress and reading statistics

★ KEY FEATURES ★

📖 READ ANY EPUB
Import your own ebooks or discover free classics from Project Gutenberg.

🌍 28+ LANGUAGES
Learn Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, and many more!

🎯 ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY
Choose from Beginner (A1-A2), Intermediate (B1-B2), or Advanced (C1-C2) levels. Words are selected based on real frequency data from language corpora.

📝 SMART VOCABULARY
Save words with their context sentences. Review them using the proven SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm used by apps like Anki.

🎨 BEAUTIFUL READER
