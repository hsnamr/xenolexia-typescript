These services receive only the individual words being translated, not your personal information or reading data.

### Book Sources

When browsing free books, the app connects to:
- Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org)
- Standard Ebooks (standardebooks.org)
- Open Library (openlibrary.org)

These connections follow each service's privacy policies.

## Data Security

Your data is protected by:
- Device-level encryption (if enabled on your device)
